## 🌸 About the project

**NordHerb** is an ongoing bilingual mobile app designed to help people recognize herbs, wild plants, and berries found in nature.

The goal is to create a calm, informative, and visually clear tool for anyone interested in edible wild plants, traditional herbal uses, natural remedies, and plant safety.

The app brings together folk knowledge and modern herbal information in one place, with offline access in mind — so it can be used outdoors, where it actually matters.

## 🌿 What the app will allow you to do

- Identify herbs and plants by name or image  
- Learn whether a plant is edible, medicinal, or toxic  
- Read traditional uses for teas, salves, and remedies  
- See which parts of the plant are safe to use  
- Save personal notes, observations, or favorite recipes  

The aim is to make plant knowledge accessible, grounded, and practical — without overwhelming the user.

## 🪴 Current development focus

Development happens in phases.  
While the repository may appear quiet at times, this is intentional.

At the moment, a large part of the work is focused on **collecting and organizing original image material**.  
Building a herb identification app turned out to be a much larger image-collection process than initially expected.

High-quality plant images require correct identification, seasonal awareness, consistency across species, and real-world fieldwork.

Because of this, development has temporarily shifted from code to groundwork.  
Active feature development will continue once a solid image base is ready.

This pause is not abandonment — it is foundation work.

## 🧠 Technical overview

The mobile app is built with **React Native**.  
Plant data is currently stored in a structured **JSON file**, which is maintained separately and likely to be migrated to **SQLite** later for better scalability and offline performance.

To manage this data efficiently, I built a small helper tool.

## 🧰 Herb Editor Lite

**Herb Editor Lite** is an offline HTML tool used to create and maintain the herb database.

It allows me to:
- add and edit herbs  
- write bilingual descriptions (FI & EN)  
- attach recipes and traditional uses  
- mark toxicity and safety notes  
- maintain consistent data structure  

The editor acts as a staging environment before data is imported into the mobile app.

## 🪷 Notes

This is a personal project created for learning, documentation, and sharing knowledge.  
All herb texts and translations are written by me, based on careful research and reliable sources.

The structure, data, and design will continue to evolve as the project grows.
