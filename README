🌸 About the project

Herb App is my ongoing project — a bilingual (Finnish & English) phone app that helps people recognize herbs, plants, and berries found in nature.
It’s meant to be a calm, informative, and beautiful tool for anyone curious about natural remedies, edible wild plants, and plant safety.

You’ll be able to:

> Identify herbs and plants by name or image
> Learn what’s edible, medicinal, or toxic
> Read how each plant is used in teas, salves, and traditional remedies
> See which parts of the plant are safe to use
> Save your own notes or favorite recipes
The idea is to make plant knowledge easy to access — even offline — and to bring together both folk wisdom and modern herbal information in one place.

🪴 What I’m building

Right now, the app is being shaped piece by piece.
The mobile version will be made with React Native, and the plant data comes from a JSON file I maintain separately (which I am most likely going to switch to SQLite later).
For now, that data is managed using a smaller helper tool I built myself — Herb Editor Lite.

🧰 Herb Editor Lite (tool)

This is the offline HTML tool that I use to build and organize all the herb data.
It helps me add new herbs, edit bilingual descriptions, attach recipes, mark toxicity, and manage the overall structure before the data is imported into the mobile app.

You can find it under:
tools/herb-editor-lite/

🪷 Notes

This is a personal project made for learning, documenting, and sharing.
All herb texts and translations are written by me, based on reliable sources and research.
I’ll keep updating the structure, data, and design as the app evolves.
