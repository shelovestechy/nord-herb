🌿 Herb Editor Lite

An offline HTML tool for managing and editing herb data for the upcoming Herb App.
Built with simplicity and clarity in mind — this version lets me edit, add, and organize herbal information directly from the browser without needing any database or backend connection.

🪴 Overview

The goal of this project is to create a small, local editor that helps me maintain and structure data for a future mobile Herb App.
Each herb has bilingual entries in Finnish and English and includes:

Name (FI / EN)

Scientific name

Origin type (native or cultivated)

Found in nature / common locations

Parts used

Uses (FI / EN)

Safety notes

Other / cultural notes

Toxicity information

Recipes and images

The current version uses a JSON file (herbs.json) as its data source.

⚙️ Features

Edit, add, and delete herb entries directly in the browser

Bilingual fields for Finnish and English

“Toxic” button for marking dangerous or restricted herbs

Image upload support

“Recipes” button to attach herbal remedies or tea formulas per herb

Simple export/import to JSON

This tool helps me maintain a clean and consistent herb database for future use in the mobile app.
